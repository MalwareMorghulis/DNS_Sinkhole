DNS Sinkhole list of FQDNs from LevelBlue (AlienVault) OTX pivots by "MalwareMorghulis"

Data was curated from automated and manual pivots to uncover suspicious or potentially hostile infrastructure.

These monikers are my own naming convention - unrelated to CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Palo Alto, etc. They are named for fun based on the TTP observed.

It is currently unconfirmed whether or not these activity clusters are related or the same threat actor. Pending deeper review at this time.

# DGA Tracker:
- Blocklist: Generic blocklist for sinkholing (some overlap here, but will eventually be independent from the 3x below).
- Cats Cradle: SMS spearphishing utilizing random characters (approximately 5-9 characters)
- Double Helix: SMS spearphishing utilizing dual-word concatenation (even words are truncated)
- Easy Rider: Toll-themed or EZ-Pass themed SMS spearphishing utlizing random character concatenation.
- Pandoras Box: USPS-themed SMS Spearphishing Domains (typically package tracking or typo-squatting service offerings like Informed Delivery)
